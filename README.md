# Multimodal-Graph-Representation

#### This repository organizes researches related to AI Technology Development for Commonsense Extraction, Reasoning, and Inference from Heterogeneous Data, especially Multimodal-Graph-Representation task. 
#### This repository summarizes following researches.

## Research list
* Interpretable Prototype-based Graph Information Bottleneck (NuerIPS 2023) - Sangwoo Seo, Sungwon Kim, and Chanyoung Park.

  * The proposed novel framework of explainable GNNs, called interpretable Prototype-based Graph Information Bottleneck (PGIB) that incorporates prototype learning within the information bottleneck framework to provide prototypes with the key subgraph from the input graph that is important for the model prediction.

* Adaptive Self-training Framework for Fine-grained Scene Graph Generation (ICLR 2024) - Kibum Kim, Kanghoon Yoon, Yeonjun In, Jinyoung Moon, Donghyun Kim, Chanyoung Park  

  * The proposed Self-Training framework for Scene Graph Generation (ST-SGG) utilizes class-specific adaptive thresholding method equipped with EMA approach and class-specific momentum to address the challenges of long-tailed predicates and semantic ambiguity.
